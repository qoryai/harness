# How a module is laid out

A module is a directory of harness files with a `qory-module.yaml` at its root. The
`core` module is the directory `modules/core`:

```
modules/core/
  qory-module.yaml
  skills/
    simple-communication/
      SKILL.md
      references/
        examples.md
        word-list.md
```

`qory.yaml` lists the module under `exports.modules`, so another repository selects it
by the name `core`.

## The manifest, qory-module.yaml

`modules/core/qory-module.yaml` sets three keys:

- `apiVersion: qory.dev/v1alpha1`, the format of the file.
- `name: core`, the module's identity. The stack lists the module by this name, and the
  composed tree contains the module at `modules/core`.
- `description`, which the report contains and `qory harness inspect` prints beside the
  module.

A directory without `qory-module.yaml` is not a module. The manifest can contain more
keys;
[the module manifest](https://github.com/qoryai/qory/blob/main/contracts/harness/v1/README.md#the-module-manifest)
in qory's compose format specification defines them.

## Skills

A skill is a directory `skills/<name>/` that contains `SKILL.md`. The directory name is
the skill's name. `SKILL.md` follows the Agent Skills layout: front matter with `name`
and `description`, then the skill's instructions. If a directory under `skills/` has no
`SKILL.md`, the compose stops with `skills/<name> has no SKILL.md`.

The compose takes the skill's directory as one entry, so every file in the directory is
composed with `SKILL.md`. The `simple-communication` skill has its longer material in
`references/examples.md` and `references/word-list.md`, and `SKILL.md` links to both
files by relative paths.

## The process template, process.yaml

A module with `process.yaml` at its root is a factory. The `software-factory` module is
one: Qory Apiary reads its `process.yaml` as the template for a software-factory
workspace. The file sets these keys:

- `apiVersion: qory.dev/v1alpha1`, the format of the file.
- `name`, `summary` and `description`, the texts of the template: `name` has at most 60
  characters, `summary` at most 200, and `description` at most 1200 characters and 80
  words.
- `type: qory.software`, the workspace type.
- `stack: software`, the stack that declares the workflows of the process. `qory.yaml`
  lists it under `exports.stacks`.
- `process`, a `qory.process/v1` document with the stages Explore, Shape, Build, Verify
  and Release. Explore runs the workflow `explore-a-ticket` in a loop of 3 rounds, and
  each stage ends with a gate at which a member approves the result.

`qory config` checks the file: each key is set, the texts are within their limits,
`exports.stacks` lists the stack, and the stack declares every workflow of the stages
under `workflows`.

## AGENTS.md

A module may ship an instruction section as `AGENTS.md` at its root. The compose joins
the `AGENTS.md` files of the stack's modules in the order of the stack, and writes the
result under the file name each runtime reads. The `core` module ships no `AGENTS.md`.

In a repository that extends the `core` stack, the compose appends the `AGENTS.md` files
of that repository's modules after the `AGENTS.md` files of the base stack's modules.

## References to other entries

When a document dispatches another composed entry, write a reference:
`${qory:skills/<name>}` for a skill, `${qory:agents/<name>}` for an agent, or
`${qory:commands/<name>}` for a command. The compose replaces the reference with the
name under which the runtime registers the entry. A program that loads the harness as a
plugin puts a prefix before every name, and there the reference resolves to the
prefixed name.

The compose reads references in agents, commands, output styles, `AGENTS.md`, and every
`.md` file under a skill's directory. If a reference selects a name that no module of
the stack ships and the stack does not bind under `bind`, the compose stops. If the
text between `${qory:` and `}` is not a reference, the compose stops, and the message
contains the file and the text.
