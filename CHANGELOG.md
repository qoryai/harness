# Changelog

Every release of the harness, newest first, in the shape of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The `core` stack, `stacks/core/qory-stack.yaml`, and the `core` module,
  `modules/core/qory-module.yaml`, published under `exports` in `qory.yaml`. Neither file
  and no `qory.yaml` setting sets a runtime, a model or a provider. `qory.yaml` sets, under
  `qory`, the qory versions that the `core` stack requires.
- `scripts/check.sh` checks that `qory config` exits 0, that `qory harness compose --dry-run`
  without `--runtime` exits 2 with `target.runtime is required`, and that the compose lists
  `skills/simple-communication` with `--runtime claude`, with `--runtime codex`, and in a
  temporary checkout that extends the `core` stack by path.
- `README.md`, `docs/extend.md` and `docs/modules.md`: how a repository extends the `core`
  stack, chooses the runtime and the model, and composes the harness, and how a module
  and a skill are laid out.
- `.github/workflows/check.yml` runs `scripts/check.sh` on each pull request, with the
  released qory at the lowest version that `qory.yaml` accepts.
